//: An operator is a special symbol or phrase that you use to check, change, or combine values.
//:
//: ## Terminology
//:
//: Operators are unary, binary, or ternary:
//:
//: * **Unary operators** operate on a single target (such as -a). Unary prefix operators appear immediately before their target (such as !b), and unary postfix operators appear immediately after their target (such as c!).
//: * **Binary operators** operate on two targets (such as 2 + 3) and are infix because they appear in between their two targets.
//: * **Ternary operators** operate on three targets. Like C, Swift has only one ternary operator, the ternary conditional operator (a ? b : c).
