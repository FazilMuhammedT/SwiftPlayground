//: # [Swift Programming Basics](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html)
//: Swift is a new programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development.
//:
//: ## Constants and Variables
//: **Constants** and **variables** associate a name. The value of a constant can‚Äôt be changed once it‚Äôs set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future.
//:
//: ### Declaring Constants and Variables
//: Constants and variables must be declared before they‚Äôre used. You declare constants with the *let* keyword and variables with the *var* keyword.
let maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts = 10
var currentLoginAttempt = 0
//:This code can be read as: ‚ÄúDeclare a new constant called maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts, and give it a value of 10. Then, declare a new variable called currentLoginAttempt, and give it an initial value of 0.‚Äù
//:
//: ### Type Annotations
//: Provide a type annotation when you declare a constant or variable, to be clear about the kind of values the constant or variable can store.
var welcomeMessage: String
//: This code can be read as: ‚ÄúDeclare a variable called welcomeMessage that is of type String.‚Äù
welcomeMessage = "Hello"
//:
//: ### Naming Constants and Variables
//: Constant and variable names can contain almost any character, including Unicode characters:
let œÄ = 3.14159
let ‰Ω†Â•Ω = "‰Ω†Â•Ω‰∏ñÁïå"
let üê∂üêÆ = "dogcow"

var friendlyWelcome = "Hello!"
friendlyWelcome = "Bonjour!" // friendlyWelcome is now "Bonjour!

let languageName = "Swift"
//languageName = "Swift++" // This is a compile-time error: languageName cannot be changed.

//: ### Printing Constants and Variables
//: Print the current value of a constant or variable with the print(_:separator:terminator:) function
print(friendlyWelcome) //Prints "Bonjour!"
//: Swift uses **string interpolation** to include the name of a constant or variable as a placeholder in a longer string, and to prompt Swift to replace it with the current value of that constant or variable. Wrap the name in parentheses and escape it with a backslash before the opening parenthesis:
print("The current value of friendlyWelcome is \(friendlyWelcome)") // Prints "The current value of friendlyWelcome is Bonjour!"
